# Next.js, Contentful & TypeScript

## General Info

You can add recipes in Contentful headless CMS and see them on the website.

This project was made for educational purposes only by following this course: [Next.js & Contentful Site Build Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9mNsYJbkNg&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jClk8wl1yJcN3Zlrr8YSA1). I have extended the code with **TypeScript** by my own and added some features.
